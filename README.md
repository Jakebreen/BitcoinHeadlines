# Bitcoin Headlines

My first app published on the PlayStore at the start of 2017 (now discontinued).
The app featured variety of crypto-currency online news websites offering users the choice of subscribing to their preferred sources to receive push notifications every hour notifying the user of each sources latest articles.

This was an ambitous project for me at the time and was coupled with a PHP API and a Droplet preforming a Cron Job every hour to parse the RSS feeds of every source to congregate news articles before sending updates to users via push notifications.
