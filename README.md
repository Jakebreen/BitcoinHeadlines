# Bitcoin Headlines

My first app published on the PlayStore at the start of 2017 with over 1000 downloads  (now discontinued). The app featured variety of crypto-currency related news outlets and offered users the choice of subscribing to their preferred sources receiving push notifications every hour notifying the user of the latest articles.

This was an ambitous project for me at the time that was coupled with a PHP API and a Droplet preforming cURL operations to congregate news articles and send updates via push notifications.
